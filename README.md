Python Based program, meant to understand oral language, extract important pieces of information, link these and create a sizeable mySql database to then be able to view it.

To be able to use this program one will need to install nltk as well as Mysql/MariaDB onto their computer. this should not be Ubuntu specific, but has been developed on it so bear that in mind.
